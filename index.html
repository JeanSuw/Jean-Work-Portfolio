        Hi! My name is Jean. I also go by Nichakamol. I am aspired software developer and cat-loving gamer. 
        <br><br>
        And speaking of games, my favorite games are Bloodborne, Dark Souls 3, Sekiro, and Elden ring. Now you notice what they have in common; they are known for their difficulties. My response is yes, so does coding. Every game I started off with no experience. I got stuck, gave up in frustration and was afraided to continue my journey to defeat the bosses. However, I want to learn more about the lore of this game. So, I pressed on learning and exploring different weapons and combat styles through playing, asking for help and researching guides. These Fromsoft's games taught me to be persverance, ask for assistances as well as understanding and accepting my flaws. I applied these whenever I get stuck in the project. 
        
        <br><br>
        I adored playing these games while my cat chilled next to me.
