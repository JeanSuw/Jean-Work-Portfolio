# Jean-Work-Portfolio

## Description
The purpose of this website is to present the empty portfolio related to bootcamp challenge and assignments for the potential recruiters. New project links will be added later on as I continued my study during coding bootcamp. 
For now you are expected to see a lot of non-functional links in portfolio sections.
